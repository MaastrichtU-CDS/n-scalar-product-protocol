# N-party scalar product protocol

This repo contains an implementation for te n-party scalar product protocol. Currently it is implemented purely locally,
it has to be transformed into a webservice.
It contains both a python and java implementation

# ToDo:

- Transform to webservice
- Look into further improving performance
- Improve RNG to use more secure RNG as opposed to java.util.Random, idem for python implementation
