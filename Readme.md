# N-party scalar product protocol

This repo contains an implementation for te n-party scalar product protocol. Currently it is implemented purely locally,
it has to be transformed into a webservice.

# ToDo:

- Transform to webservice
- Look into further improving performance?
- Improve RNG to use more secure RNG as opposed to java.util.Random
